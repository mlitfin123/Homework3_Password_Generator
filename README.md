# Homework3_Password_Generator
https://mlitfin123.github.io/Homework3_Password_Generator/

This project was done as a part of a homework project for the University of Miami Bootcamp.

The HTML and CSS of a website was given with a task of creating a script to allow the buttons to automatically generate a password between 8 and 128 characters based on the user's preferences. This project was not easy as it took quite a bit of research to find the correct commands to get the script to properly loop through each user selected option and concatenate them together to make a proper password.

This page was designed for the user to be able to click the button and be prompted for various choices on what they would like to include in thier password. If the user does not choose a character number between 8 and 128 then they cannot continue, however if the user does choose an accepted number then he or she will be alerted with a series of prompts to confirm which character types to include in the password. If the character type is chosen then it will be included and if not then it will be filtered out. Once all the prompts have been displayed the password appears in the word box on screen.
